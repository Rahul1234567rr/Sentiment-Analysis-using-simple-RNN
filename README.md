# IMDB Movie Review Sentiment Analysis Using Simple RNN

This project aims to classify movie reviews from the IMDB dataset as either positive or negative. The model used for this task is a Simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The purpose of the model is to understand the sentiment behind the reviews by analyzing the sequence of words in each review.

## Dataset Details
IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset: This dataset contains 50,000 movie reviews labeled as either positive or negative. It is a commonly used dataset for sentiment classification tasks.
Model Architecture
The model consists of the following layers:
## Model architecture
Embedding Layer: Transforms input words into dense vectors of fixed size (10000 words, 128 dimensions).

Simple RNN Layer: Captures sequential information in the text, with 128 units and 'relu' activation.

Dense Output Layer: A fully connected layer with a sigmoid activation function to predict the probability of the review being positive or negative.
## Dependencies
To run this project, the following Python libraries are required:

Python 3.9

Streamlit

TensorFlow

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Pickle

You can install these dependencies using the following command:
```bash
